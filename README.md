## File structure

Combining resources across OSF and GitHub should yield the following structure.

## How to get the data

As of the time of writing, these are on a Share Drive on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0AHwZeCcC1chbUk9PVA).


## How to run

### From source

To run this code, use the following diagramatic acyclic graph (DAG). Note that this applies for each experiment. Note that you need to combine all resources first into one repository to run.

![How to run diagram](https://github.com/serghiou/repo-template/blob/main/how-to-run.jpg?raw=true)

### From the Dockerfile

To build and run the Docker container, use the following commands in your terminal, executed in the directory containing your Dockerfile (note that Docker needs to be installed and running before you run these commands in your terminal - also, you need to make sure that you have the image by running the following in your terminal: `docker pull rocker/r-ver:4.2.3 `):

```sh
docker build -t calcineurin_image .
docker run calcineurin_image
```

Then, get the container ID by looking underneath the container name or running

```sh
docker ps -a
```

Finally, retrieve the output:

```sh
docker cp -a 355b7a4764f6:/project/code/final_analytics/ code/final_analytics/docker
```

or

```sh
docker cp 355b7a4764f6:/project/code/final_analytics/paper-from-code.html code/final_analytics/paper-from-code_docker.html
```

## How to get help

If you encounter a bug, please file an issue with a minimal reproducible example [here](https://github.com/serghiou/repo-template/issues) and please Label it as a "bug" (option on the right of your window). For help on how to use the package, please file an issue with a clearly actionable question [here](https://github.com/serghiou/repo-template/issues) and label it as "help wanted." For all other questions and discussion, please email the first author.


## How to contribute

1. Create an issue as described above.
2. Create a branch from the issue as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue).
3. Branch names should use the format and voice of this example: "152-bugfix-fix-broken-links".
4. Issue a pull request to initiate a review.
5. Merge using "Rebase and merge" after you've squashed all non-critical commits.
